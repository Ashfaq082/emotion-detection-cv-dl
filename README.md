# emotion-detection-cv-dl

A deep learning project for emotion detection using computer vision and image-based datasets.

## Features
- Face detection using OpenCV
- Emotion classification using CNN
- emotion detection system using synthetic facial expression data generated from an AI-based text-to-image generative model

## 1400 images
This involved creating a diverse dataset of 1,400 facial images, each labeled with emotions such as happiness, sadness, fear, anger, and disgust, based on corresponding textual prompts.

## Practical Implementation
The categories that evoke all seven emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, disgust, and contempt) 

## Model Implementation
Emotion Detection from Synthetic Facial Expressions Using Deep Learning
Platform: Spyder (Anaconda) | Language: Python | Dataset: 1,400 AI-generated images | Categories: 10 Emotions (e.g., Happy, Sad, Angry, Fearful, Disgusted, Surprised, Neutral, etc.)
